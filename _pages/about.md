I am Chenglong Chu, an Engineer at Kwai OneRec Team. I received my M.S. from Dalian University of Technology, advised by [Prof. Fangming Zhong](http://ubinec.org/zfm/cn/index.html).

My research interests include:

- **Generative Recommendation**: OneRec series.
- **Unified Understanding and Generation Models**: Keye-VL series, OneBase.

I am glad to chat about research, advising, collaborations. If you are interested in doing research with me, feel free to contact me.
